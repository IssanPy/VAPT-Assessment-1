Vulnerability

Local File Inclusion (LFI) – Directory Traversal

Description

The application dynamically includes files based on user-controlled input without proper validation. By manipulating the file path parameter, an attacker can traverse directories and include sensitive internal files, such as administrative pages, resulting in unauthorized access.

Affected Endpoint
/lab/file-inclusion/learn-the-capital-1/

Proof of Concept (PoC)
Payload Used
../admin.php

Injection Method

The payload was injected into the file inclusion parameter using Burp Suite, allowing traversal outside the intended directory.

Observed Result

The application successfully loaded the admin page, granting unauthorized access without authentication.

Steps to Reproduce

Navigate to File Inclusion → Learn the Capital 1.

Intercept the request using Burp Suite.

Modify the file parameter to:

../admin.php


Forward the request.

Observe that the admin page is displayed without permission.

Impact Analysis

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to access restricted files and sensitive application components. This can lead to:

Unauthorized access to admin functionality

Disclosure of sensitive configuration files

Application compromise

Further exploitation (RCE if combined with other flaws)

CVSS 3.1 Base Score

8.6 (High)

Vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

Risk Rating

High

Remediation / Mitigation

Do not include files based on user input.

Implement strict allowlists for includable files.

Use absolute paths and fixed file mappings.

Disable directory traversal (../) patterns.

Apply proper access control checks for admin resources.

Screenshot Evidence

Include:

Burp request showing ../admin.php

Loaded admin page without authentication

Vulnerability

Local File Inclusion (LFI) – Filter Bypass via Directory Traversal

Description

The application attempts to implement security measures to prevent direct file inclusion attacks. However, improper filtering allows an attacker to bypass these protections by manipulating directory traversal patterns. This results in unauthorized access to restricted files, including administrative pages.

Affected Endpoint
/lab/file-inclusion/learn-the-capital-2/

Proof of Concept (PoC)
Payload Used
..../admin.php

Injection Method

The payload was injected into the file inclusion parameter using Burp Suite, bypassing the implemented directory traversal filter.

Observed Result

The application successfully loaded the admin page without authentication, confirming that the security measures can be bypassed.

Steps to Reproduce

Navigate to File Inclusion → Learn the Capital 2.

Intercept the request using Burp Suite.

Modify the file parameter to:

..../admin.php


Forward the request.

Observe that the admin page is displayed without proper authorization.

Impact Analysis

Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass access controls and include sensitive internal files. This can lead to:

Unauthorized access to administrative interfaces

Exposure of sensitive application files

Further exploitation chains (e.g., RCE with file upload or logs)

Complete application compromise

CVSS 3.1 Base Score

8.6 (High)

Vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

Risk Rating

High

Remediation / Mitigation

Avoid using user input directly in file include operations.

Implement strict allowlists for valid file names.

Normalize and validate file paths before processing.

Block traversal sequences and encoded bypass techniques.

Enforce authentication and authorization checks on admin resources.

Screenshot Evidence

Include:

Burp request showing ..../admin.php

Admin page rendered without authentication

Vulnerability

Local File Inclusion (LFI) – Whitelist Bypass via Directory Traversal

Description

The application attempts to restrict file inclusion by enforcing a whitelist directory (file/). However, it fails to properly normalize and validate the requested file path. By using directory traversal sequences, an attacker can escape the whitelisted directory and include sensitive internal files, such as the administrative page, without authorization.

Affected Endpoint
/lab/file-inclusion/learn-the-capital-3/

Proof of Concept (PoC)
Payload Used
file/../../admin.php

Injection Point

File inclusion parameter (manipulated using Burp Suite).

Observed Result

The application successfully included and rendered the admin page, granting unauthorized access despite the presence of whitelist-based security controls.

Steps to Reproduce

Navigate to File Inclusion → Learn the Capital 3.

Intercept the request using Burp Suite.

Identify the file inclusion parameter.

Replace its value with:

file/../../admin.php


Forward the request.

Observe that the admin page is displayed without authentication.

Impact Analysis

This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass whitelist-based file inclusion controls and access sensitive internal files. Potential impacts include:

Unauthorized access to admin functionality

Disclosure of sensitive application files

Bypass of access controls

Full application compromise when chained with other vulnerabilities

CVSS 3.1 Base Score

8.6 (High)

Vector:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

Risk Rating

High

Remediation / Mitigation

Do not rely solely on directory-based whitelisting.

Normalize file paths before validation.

Reject traversal sequences such as ../ after normalization.

Use fixed file mappings instead of dynamic includes.

Enforce authentication and authorization checks for admin resources.

Screenshot Evidence

Include:

Burp request showing file/../../admin.php

Admin page rendered without authentication
