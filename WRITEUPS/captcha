CAPTCHA Bypass via CAPTCHA Reuse

Description

The application implements a CAPTCHA mechanism to prevent automated submissions. However, the CAPTCHA value remains valid even after successful verification. An attacker can reuse a previously solved CAPTCHA token to submit unlimited requests, effectively bypassing CAPTCHA protection.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

Open the CAPTCHA-protected form.

Solve the CAPTCHA once and submit a valid request.

Intercept the request using Burp Suite and send it to Repeater.

Modify only the user_comment parameter.

Reuse the same captcha value.

Send the request multiple times.

Observed Result:
Each request returns HTTP 302 Found, confirming successful submission without solving a new CAPTCHA.

Example Request:

POST /lab/captcha-bypass/broken-captcha HTTP/1.1

user_comment=Hacked&captcha=NE4655

Impact Analysis

CAPTCHA protection can be completely bypassed

Enables automated spam, brute-force attacks, and abuse

Defeats bot-mitigation controls

Increases risk of DoS, credential stuffing, and form abuse

CVSS 3.1 Score

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)

(You can justify Medium because it impacts integrity, not direct data loss.)

Risk Severity

Medium

Root Cause

CAPTCHA value is not invalidated after successful verification

CAPTCHA token remains reusable across multiple requests

Remediation / Mitigation

Invalidate CAPTCHA token immediately after successful use

Bind CAPTCHA to:

Session

Single request

Timestamp

Implement server-side CAPTCHA regeneration

Add rate limiting and request throttling

Secure Example:

unset($_SESSION['captcha']);

Screenshots / Evidence

Burp Repeater showing repeated 302 Found

Same CAPTCHA value reused successfully

Modified user_comment with unchanged captcha

What to screenshot (important)

Take one screenshot showing:

Burp Repeater

Same captcha value

Multiple successful responses (302 / 200)

Vulnerability Name

CAPTCHA Bypass via Client-Side Manipulation (Logic Flaw)

Description

The application uses a CAPTCHA mechanism based on simple arithmetic values submitted by the client. The server trusts CAPTCHA operands and results provided in the HTTP request instead of validating them securely on the server side. As a result, an attacker can arbitrarily modify the CAPTCHA parameters and submit a forged correct answer, bypassing CAPTCHA validation entirely.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

Open the CAPTCHA-protected form.

Intercept the submission request using Burp Suite.

Observe CAPTCHA-related parameters in the request (e.g., numbers and result).

Modify the CAPTCHA operands and result to any values that satisfy the calculation.

Forward the modified request.

Example Manipulation:

captcha_num1=1
captcha_num2=1
captcha_result=2


Submit the request.

Observed Result:
The server accepts the request and returns a success response, confirming CAPTCHA bypass.

Impact Analysis

CAPTCHA protection is completely ineffective

Allows automated submissions without solving real challenges

Enables spam, brute-force attempts, and abuse of application functionality

Weakens overall application security controls

CVSS 3.1 Base Score

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
Base Score: 5.3 (Medium)

Risk Severity

Medium

Root Cause

CAPTCHA logic is calculated using client-supplied values

No server-side verification of CAPTCHA challenge integrity

Application assumes CAPTCHA parameters sent by client are trustworthy

Remediation / Mitigation

Perform CAPTCHA generation and validation entirely on the server

Do not accept CAPTCHA operands or results from client input

Use secure CAPTCHA libraries (Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, etc.)

Bind CAPTCHA to session and invalidate after use

Screenshots / Evidence

Burp Suite request showing modified CAPTCHA values

Successful server response after manipulation

No CAPTCHA regeneration or validation failure observed
