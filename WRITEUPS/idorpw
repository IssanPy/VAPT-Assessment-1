VULN 14 IDOR 
Vulnerability Name

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) – Unauthorized Invoice Access

Description

The application allows users to access invoice objects by directly specifying an identifier in the view parameter. The server does not validate whether the requested invoice belongs to the authenticated user. By modifying this parameter, an attacker can access invoices of other users without authorization.

Affected Endpoint
POST /lab/idor/invoices/

Proof of Concept (PoC)
Request Modification

Original request:

view=1


Modified request:

view=2

Result

The server returned invoice details belonging to another user, confirming unauthorized access.

Steps to Reproduce

Login as a normal user.

Navigate to the Invoices page.

Intercept the request using Burp Suite and send it to Repeater.

Modify the view parameter to another numeric value.

Send the request.

Observe invoice data belonging to a different user.

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) – Ticket Price Manipulation

Description

The application trusts client-side parameters for ticket pricing. By modifying the ticket_money parameter in the purchase request, a user can buy tickets for less than the fixed server-defined price. The server fails to validate the price against authoritative values, resulting in an IDOR/business logic flaw.

Affected Endpoint
POST /lab/idor/ticket-sales/index.php

Proof of Concept (PoC)
Original Request
amount=2&ticket_money=10

Modified Request
amount=2&ticket_money=5

Result

The purchase succeeds and the total charged reflects the manipulated (lower) price, allowing tickets to be bought below the regular price.

Steps to Reproduce

Login as a normal user and navigate to Ticket Sales.

Initiate a ticket purchase and intercept the request with Burp Suite.

Send the request to Repeater.

Modify ticket_money to a lower value.

Send the request and observe a successful purchase at the reduced price.

Impact Analysis

An attacker can:

Purchase tickets at arbitrary prices

Cause financial loss to the application

Bypass pricing controls and business rules
